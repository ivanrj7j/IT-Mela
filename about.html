        <h2 class="highlight">About Us</h2>
        An amusement park is a park that features various attractions, such as rides and games, as well as other
        events for entertainment purposes. A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and
        attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary
        and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They
        are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of
        age groups. While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more
        intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects.
        <br><br>
        Amusement parks evolved from European fairs, pleasure gardens, and large picnic areas, which were created
        for people's recreation. World's fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the
        emergence of the amusement park industry.[2] Lake Compounce opened in 1846 and is considered the oldest,
        continuously-operating amusement park in North America.[3][4][5][6][7]
        <br><br>


        <h2 class="highlight">Origins</h2>

        The amusement park evolved from three earlier traditions: traveling or periodic fairs, pleasure gardens, and
        exhibitions such as world fairs. The oldest influence was the periodic fair of the Middle Ages - one of the
        earliest was the Bartholomew Fair in England from 1133. By the 18th and 19th centuries, they had evolved
        into places of entertainment for the masses, where the public could view freak shows, acrobatics, conjuring
        and juggling, take part in competitions and walk through menageries.
        Frederick Savage's 'Sea-On-Land' carousel, where the riders would pitch up and down as if they were on the
        sea, was the first amusement ride installed in Dreamland Margate in 1880 England.
        <br><br>
        A wave of innovation in the 1860s and 1870s created mechanical rides, such as the steam-powered carousel
        (built by Thomas Bradshaw, at the Aylsham Fair), and its derivatives, notably from Frederick Savage of
        King's Lynn, Norfolk whose fairground machinery was exported all over the world; his "galloping horses"
        innovation is seen in carousels today.[8] This inaugurated the era of the modern funfair ride, as the
        working classes were increasingly able to spend their surplus wages on entertainment.[9]
        <br><br>
        The second influence was the pleasure garden. An example of this is the world's oldest amusement park,
        Bakken ("The Hill"), which opened in mainland Europe in 1583. It is located north of Copenhagen in
        Klampenborg, Denmark.[10][11]
        Vauxhall Gardens, founded in 1661 as one of the first pleasure gardens
        <br><br>
        Another early garden was the Vauxhall Gardens, founded in 1661 in London. By the late 18th century, the site
        had an admission fee for its many attractions. It regularly drew enormous crowds, with its paths often noted
        for romantic assignations; tightrope walkers, hot air balloon ascents, concerts and fireworks providing
        amusement. Although the gardens were originally designed for the elites, they soon became places of great
        social diversity. Public firework displays were put on at Marylebone Gardens, and Cremorne Gardens offered
        music, dancing, and animal acrobatics displays.[12]
        <br><br>
        Prater in Vienna, Austria, began as a royal hunting ground which was opened in 1766 for public enjoyment.
        There followed coffee-houses and caf√©s, which led to the beginnings of the Wurstelprater as an amusement
        park.<br><br>

        The concept of a fixed park for amusement was further developed with the beginning of the world's fairs. The
        first World fair began in 1851 with the construction of the landmark Crystal Palace in London, England. The
        purpose of the exposition was to celebrate the industrial achievement of the nations of the world and it was
        designed to educate and entertain the visitors.[13]
        The original Ferris Wheel, World's Columbian Exposition, 1893
        <br><br>
        American cities and businesses also saw the world's fair as a way of demonstrating economic and industrial
        success.[13] The World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Illinois was an early precursor to the
        modern amusement park. The fair was an enclosed site, that merged entertainment, engineering and education
        to entertain the masses. It set out to bedazzle the visitors, and successfully did so with a blaze of lights
        from the "White City."[2] To make sure that the fair was a financial success, the planners included a
        dedicated amusement concessions area called the Midway Plaisance.[13] Rides from this fair captured the
        imagination of the visitors and of amusement parks around the world, such as the first steel Ferris wheel,
        which was found in many other amusement areas, such as the Prater by 1896. Also, the experience of the
        enclosed ideal city with wonder, rides, culture and progress (electricity), was based on the creation of an
        illusory place.[2]
        <br><br>
        The "midway" introduced at the Columbian Exposition would become a standard part of most amusement parks,
        fairs, carnivals, and circuses. The midway contained not only the rides, but other concessions and
        entertainments such as shooting galleries, penny arcades, games of chance, and shows.[14]
        Trolley parks and pleasure resorts
        Main article: Trolley park
        <br><br>
        Many modern amusement parks evolved from earlier pleasure resorts that had become popular with the public
        for day-trips or weekend holidays, for example, seaside areas such as Blackpool, United Kingdom and Coney
        Island, United States.[15] In the United States, some amusement parks grew from picnic groves established
        along rivers and lakes that provided bathing and water sports, such as Lake Compounce in Connecticut, first
        established as a picturesque picnic park in 1846, and Riverside Park in Massachusetts, founded in the 1870s
        along the Connecticut River.[16]
        <br><br>
        The trick was getting the public to the seaside or resort location. For Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York,
        on the Atlantic Ocean, a horse-drawn streetcar line brought pleasure seekers to the beach beginning in 1829.
        In 1875, a million passengers rode the Coney Island Railroad, and in 1876 two million visited Coney Island.
        Hotels and amusements were built to accommodate both the upper classes and the working class at the beach.
        The first carousel was installed in the 1870s, the first roller coaster, the "Switchback Railway", in 1884.
        Blackpool Beach in 1895
        <br><br>
        In England, Blackpool was a popular beachside location beginning in the 1700s. It rose to prominence as a
        seaside resort with the completion in 1846 of a branch line to Blackpool from Poulton on the main Preston
        and Wyre Joint Railway line. A sudden influx of visitors, arriving by rail, provided the motivation for
        entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and a rapid cycle
        of growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s.
        Photochrom of the Promenade c. 1898
        <br><br>
        In 1879, large parts of the promenade at Blackpool were wired. The lighting and its accompanying pageants
        reinforced Blackpool's status as the North of England's most prominent holiday resort, and its specifically
        working class character. It was the forerunner of the present-day Blackpool Illuminations. By the 1890s, the
        town had a population of 35,000, and could accommodate 250,000 holidaymakers. The number of annual visitors,
        many staying for a week, was estimated at three million.
        <br><br>
        In the final decade of the 19th century, electric trolley lines were developed in many large American
        cities. Companies that established the trolley lines also developed trolley parks as destinations of these
        lines. Trolley parks such as Atlanta's Ponce de Leon Park, or Reading's Carsonia Park were initially popular
        natural leisure spots before local streetcar companies purchased the sites, expanding them from picnic
        groves to include regular entertainments, mechanical amusements, dance halls, sports fields, boat rides,
        restaurants and other resort facilities.
        Steel Pier circa the 1910s
        <br><br>
        Some of these parks were developed in resort locations, such as bathing resorts at the seaside in New Jersey
        and New York. A premiere example in New Jersey was Atlantic City, a famous vacation resort. Entrepreneurs
        erected amusement parks on piers that extended from the boardwalk out over the ocean. The first of several
        was the Ocean Pier in 1891, followed later by the Steel Pier in 1898, both of which boasted rides and
        attractions typical of that time, such as Midway-style games and electric trolley rides. The boardwalk also
        had the first Roundabout installed in 1892 by William Somers, a wooden predecessor to the Ferris Wheel.
        Somers installed two others in Asbury Park, New Jersey and Coney Island, New York.[17][18]
        <br><br>
        Another early park was the Eldorado Amusement Park that opened in 1891 on the banks of the Hudson River,
        overlooking New York City. It consisted of 25 acres.[19]
        Modern amusement parks
        Dreamland tower and lagoon in 1907
        <br><br>
        The first permanent enclosed entertainment area, regulated by a single company, was founded in Coney Island
        in 1895: Sea Lion Park at Coney Island in Brooklyn. This park was one of the first to charge admission to
        get into the park in addition to sell tickets for rides within the park.[2]
        <br><br>
        In 1897, Sea Lion Park was joined by Steeplechase Park, the first of three major amusement parks that would
        open in the Coney Island area. George Tilyou designed the park to provide thrills and entertainment. The
        combination of the nearby population center of New York City and the ease of access to the area made Coney
        Island the embodiment of the American amusement park.[2] Coney Island also featured Luna Park (1903) and
        Dreamland (1904). Coney Island was a huge success and by the year 1910 attendance on days could reach a
        million people.[2] Fueled by the efforts of Frederick Ingersoll who borrowed the name, other "Luna Parks"
        were quickly erected worldwide and opened to rave reviews.
        <br><br>
        The first amusement park in England was opened in 1896 - the Blackpool Pleasure Beach by W. G. Bean. In
        1904, Sir Hiram Maxim's Captive Flying Machine was introduced; he had designed an early aircraft powered by
        steam engines that had been unsuccessful and instead opened up a pleasure ride of flying carriages that
        revolved around a central pylon. Other rides included the 'Grotto' (a fantasy ride), 'River Caves' (a scenic
        railway), water chutes and a tobogganing tower.[20]
        <br><br>
        Fire was a constant threat in those days, as much of the construction within the amusement parks of the era
        was wooden. In 1911, Dreamland was the first Coney Island amusement park to completely burn down; in 1944,
        Luna Park also burned to the ground. Most of Ingersoll's Luna Parks were similarly destroyed, usually by
        arson, before his death in 1927.
        The Golden Age

        <br><br>
        During the Gilded Age, many Americans began working fewer hours[21] and had more disposable income. With
        new-found money and time to spend on leisure activities, Americans sought new venues for entertainment.
        Amusement parks, set up outside major cities and in rural areas, emerged to meet this new economic
        opportunity. These parks served as a source of fantasy and escape from real life.[2] By the early 1900s,
        hundreds of amusement parks were operating in the United States and Canada. Trolley parks stood outside many
        cities. Parks like Atlanta's Ponce de Leon[22] and Idora Park,[23] near Youngstown, OH, took passengers to
        traditionally popular picnic grounds, which by the late 1890s also often included rides like the Giant
        Swing, Carousel, and Shoot-the-Chutes. These amusement parks were often based on nationally known parks or
        world's fairs: they had names like Coney Island, White City, Luna Park, or Dreamland. The American Gilded
        Age was, in fact, amusement parks' Golden Age that reigned until the late 1920s.
        <br><br>
        The Golden Age of amusement parks also included the advent of the kiddie park. Founded in 1925, the original
        Kiddie Park is located in San Antonio, Texas and is still in operation today. The kiddie parks became
        popular all over America after World War II.[24]
        <br><br>
        This era saw the development of new innovations in roller coasters that included extreme drops and speeds to
        thrill the riders. By the end of the First World War, people seemed to want an even more exciting
        entertainment, a need met by roller coasters.[25] Although the development of the automobile provided people
        with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs, the amusement parks after the war continued to
        be successful, while urban amusement parks saw declining attendance.[2] The 1920s is more properly known as
        the Golden Age of roller coasters, being the decade of frenetic building for these rides.[25]
        Scenic Railway at Margate, 1930s
        <br><br>
        In England, Dreamland Margate opened in 1880 with Frederick Savage's carousel the first amusement ride
        installed. In 1920 the Scenic Railway rollercoaster opened to the public with great success, carrying half a
        million passengers in its first year.[26] The park also installed other rides common to the time including a
        smaller roller coaster, the Joy Wheel, Miniature Railway, The Whip and the River Caves. A ballroom was
        constructed on the site of the Skating Rink in 1920 and in 1923 a Variety Cinema was built on the site.
        Between 1920 and 1935 over ¬£500,000 was invested in the site, constantly adding new rides and facilities and
        culminating in the construction of the Dreamland Cinema complex in 1934 which stands to this day.[27]
        <br><br>
        Meanwhile, the Blackpool Pleasure Beach was also being developed. Frequent large-scale investments were
        responsible for the construction of many new rides, including the Virginia Reel, Whip, Noah's Ark, Big
        Dipper and Dodgems. In the 1920s the "Casino Building" was built, which remains to this day. In 1923, land
        was reclaimed from the sea front. It was at this period that the park moved to its 44-acre (180,000 m2)
        current location above what became Watson Road, which was built under the Pleasure Beach in 1932. During
        this time Joseph Emberton, an architect famous for his work in the amusement trade was brought in to
        redesign the architectural style of the Pleasure Beach rides, working on the "Grand National" roller
        coaster, "Noah's Ark" and the Casino building to name a few.
